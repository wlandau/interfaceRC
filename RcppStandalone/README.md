# RcppStandalone

The examples here use Rcpp in a standalone R script. As long as you have `Rcpp` installed, you can run `RcppStandalone.R` in an R session to test the examples.

The first example was taken directly from [Hadley Wickham's Advanced R chapter on `Rcpp`](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Rcpp.html) (the "Matrix input, vector output" example). There is an additional example regarding access to slots of s4 objects.
