# RcppStandalone

The example here, taken directly from [Hadley Wickham's Advanced R chapter on `Rcpp`](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Rcpp.html) ("Matrix input, vector output"), uses Rcpp in a standalone R script. As long as you have `Rcpp` installed, you can run `RcppStandalone.R` in an R session to test it.
